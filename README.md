## About Minesweeper
[Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) is a single-player puzzle video game. 
The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field [[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)).
